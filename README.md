ðŸ§¹ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Data Cleaning
This notebook covers key steps in preparing the dataset for analysis and modeling:

âœ… Data Cleaning
Converted data types for consistency and accuracy (e.g., numeric columns, datetime formatting)

Handled missing values by dropping rows with NaN in important columns like gross and budget

ðŸ“ˆ Data Visualization
Explored distributions and relationships between variables using plots

Used matplotlib and seaborn to create insightful visualizations that reveal patterns, trends, and potential outliers

These steps ensure the dataset is clean, well-understood, and ready for further analysis or machine learning tasks.
